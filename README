Hack-Assembler by bp
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
--------
Java assembler for the Hack Architecture referenced in "The Elements of Computing
Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan and 
Shimon Schocken.

Description:
------------
This is the Java implementation of the assembler for the Hack Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA). The motivation for this project is to be able to create
a basic assembler that can be tested against the book's assembler program.
The code is my own implementation. It is not meant to be bullet-proof so there may
be areas that need improvement. It will definitely be improved as I continue to
work on it. Javadocs have been included and can be found in the /doc directory.

Current Version:
----------------
0.3 -	Basic functionality completed. Can use comments as long as it's in its own line.

Test Files/Output:
-----------
add.asm - This the same code from the book without in-line comments. 
add.hack - This is the binary output created by my assembler.
addComparison-Original.hack - This is the binary comparison file produced by the author's assembler.
